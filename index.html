<div class="1st">
  <p>Generals gathered in their masses
    Just like witches at black masses
    Evil minds that plot
  <span>destruction</span>
  Sorcerers of death's construction
  In the fields the bodies burning
  As the
  <span>war</span>
  machine keeps turning
  Death and hatred to mankind
  Poisoning their
  <span>brainwashed minds</span></p>
</div>


<h2>Oh lord yeah!</h2>


<div class="2nd">
  <p><span>Politicians hide themselves away</span>
  They only started the war
  Why should they go out to fight?
  They leave that role to the poor
</p>
</div>

<div class="3rd">
  <p>Time will tell on their power minds
  <span>Making war just for fun</span>
  Treating people just like pawns in chess
  Wait 'til their judgement day comes
  Yeah!</p>
</div>

<div class="4th">
  <p>Now in darkness world stops turning
  Ashes where the <span>bodies burning</span>
  No more war pigs have the power
  Hand of God has struck the hour
  <span>Day of judgement</span>, God is calling
  On their knees the war pig's crawling
  <span>Begging mercy </span>for their sins
  Satan laughing spreads his wings
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Oh lord yeah!</h2>
